# FORMAT

Structures must be declared using the STRUCT statement (as seen below):

```c
/////struct syntax/////

struct <structureName>
{
    <data type> <member_name1>;
    <data type> <member_name2>;
    <data type> <member_name3>;
};

/////struct example//////

struct lotForSale
{
    int lot_number;
    float lot_cost;
    float square_footage;
};
```
---
Structures can be defined using different methods.
1. Initialized in conjunction with declaration.
```c
struct lotForSale
{
    int lot_number;
    float lot_cost;
    float square_footage;
};
/////stuct definition example #1/////
int main(void)
{
    struct lotForSale timberRange = { 8755, 2500, 6534 };
}
```
2. Individual members may be accessed/modified using the dot(.) operator.
```c
struct lotForSale
{
    int lot_number;
    float lot_cost;
    float square_footage;
};
/////stuct definition example #2/////
int main(void)
{
    //Declare a struct variable
    struct LotForSale elmStreet;

    //Define the first member
    elmStreet.lot_number = 8755;
    
    //Define the second member
    elmStreet.lot_cost = 25000;
    
    //Define the third member
    elmStreet.square_footage = 6534;
}
```
3. Pointers to structs may access/modify members using the arrow (->) operator.
```c
struct lotForSale
{
    int lot_number;
    float lot_cost;
    float square_footage;
};
/////stuct definition example #3/////
int main(void)
{
    //LotForSale variable
    struct LotForSale millionaireEstates;
    
    //LotForSale variable
    struct LotForSale countrysideAcres;
    
    struct LotForSale * currentLot = &millionaireEstates;
    
    //Define first member
    currentLot->lot_number = 1000000;
    
    //Define second member
    currentLot->lot_cost = 1000000;

    //Define third member
    currentLot->square_footage = 1000000; 
}
```
