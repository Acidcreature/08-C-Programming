# Memory Visualization
As we discussed previously, memory is simply a location where data is stored.  To access this data, your program must know how to find it.  This is accomplished by addressing the data in memory.  
  * Memory addresses are normally displayed in hexadecimal.  Each memory address refers to one byte of memory.  Each line in this display (see: dword) represents four bytes of memory values/data.  Thus, each line in this display (see: dword) actually contains four memory addresses.  The memory address listed on a line doesnâ€™t represent an entire line.  It merely represents the address of the first byte of information (see: Memory Values).
