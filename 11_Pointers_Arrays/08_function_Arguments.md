## Function Arguments

## Introduction

* Generally speaking, functions take input (arguments) and provdes output (return Value)
* Arguments may take the form of **value** or **reference** depending on how they are 'passed' to the function
* **Pass by Value** - functions receive a copy in memory or the actual parameter's value (which is a local scope)
* **Pass by Reference** - Advanced functions can access and modify memory space

### Comments
Really, this section should be titled “Pointers as function arguments”.  
A good analogy for the difference between “pass by value” and “pass by reference” is sharing a web page with someone.

**Pass by Value** – I print the web page out for you.  Your copy is your own and local to you.  Any modifications you make to the page will not affect the original web page.  Also, you will not see any changes that are made to the web page after your copy was printed.  If you shred that paper, your merely destroying your personal copy of the web page.  The original still exists.

**Pass by Reference** – I give you the URL of the web page.  You now know how to find the information on your own.  You’ll also see changes that are made to the original.  Any changes you make to that web page will be seen by everyone else who follows that URL.  If you delete the URL, you’re merely destroying the reference to that page, not the page itself.
